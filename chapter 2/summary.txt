Summary
A variable is a container in which a value may be stored for subsequent use in an R Script program.

The name of a variable is a unique identifier that must avoid the R keywords.

An identifier name in R must begin with a letter (or a period followed by a letter) and may subsequently contain only letters, digits, periods, or underscore characters.

Identifier names are case-sensitive, and those with multiple words can separate each word with a period character.

Values are assigned to variables in R programming using the <- assignment operator.

The R interpreter ignores whitespace and ignores comments on lines that begin with a # hash character.

The four main data types in R programming are character, double, integer, and Boolean.

Each R variable is a vector that can contain multiple values.

A vector may only contain values of the same data type, but a list structure may contain values of mixed data types.

A list is created by specifying values as a comma-separated list of arguments to the built-in list( ) function.

Vectors and lists both store values within elements that are indexed starting at one.

Single values in vectors and lists can be retrieved using the identifier name and an index number in [ ] square brackets.

Single values in named elements can be retrieved using the identifier and element name separated by the $ operator.

The built-in plot( ) function produces a scatter plot depicting data magnitude versus index.

Data stored in any R structure creates an object in the RStudio environment.

Help can be sought in RStudio on its Help tab, or using the help( ) function, or via the auto-completion popup box.
